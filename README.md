# Mu2
It's time for Mush's to enter 2015.
Welcome to Mu2 where everything lives in a database and it has a prebuilt web interface.
This assumes Pennmush and a database that supports MySQL syntax.

# Systems

## MuReq
Welcome to a +request system that actually helps you work instead of hindering you. Welcome to a +request system that doesn't get up in your bidness with all those notices about activity. Welcome to a +request system that thinks buckets are old school and categories and tags are new school. Welcome to a +request system that lives entirely in a database. Welcome to a +request system that has a dynamic, complex permission structure meant to respect staff and players as individuals. Actually, we can sum this up with Welcome to the 21st century of Mu Job Systems, what we should have had since 2000. Read the individual readme for more information.

## Arc
What if we stored player sheets in a database? Besides the obvious benefits, that would make accessing them from outside the game immediately easier and more accesible. Welcome to Arc. Arc is a system for defining categories of stats and storing those in the database. It then stores the player's own attributes in the database so that they can be queried at any time. Additionally, this approach makes statistical analysis of individual stats trivial.
